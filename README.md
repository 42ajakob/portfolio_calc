# A simple investment Portfolio calculator written in python.

Takes the individual Index Funds total returns over X amount of years as input.
Returns the weight it would give each Fund individually based on it's contribution to the total return of the portfolio.
And returns the annual percentage of your portfolio.

# Why does it exists?
To have a convient way to do the math of my portfolio for me lol.
No but seriously to have a easy evaluation of how well it would have competed in the past and what would have been the returns of this weighted allocation.
I came up with this idea using the beauty of basic math to figure out how much weight each asset should have.
Instead of guessing like "Mhmm ok I go 95% on America and 5% distributed equally on all the other ETFs".

# Do I have to consider something when using it?
That the input your giving is correct.
It's not there to calculate your Stocks/Bonds distribution. This is ultimatly your decision.
What you can use it for is figuring out the distrubtion of all your bonds or stocks.
That's what it's designed for.
And the last thing is that if you have 5 stocks in America and 2 for the rest of the world.
Your gonna get a very high precentage for America. At least if America's Stock Market didn't burn by the time you read this.\

So you would have to put all the ETFs from America first into the calculator.
And then use the total return of your America ETFs as a single ETF input in the calculator to get a more evenly spread asset allocation.
Those 100% you got from the first calculation. Well now you have to make it fit into the second calulation percentage. At least until I upgrade this calculator.
Sooooo GL HF with it.
