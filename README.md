# A simple Portfolio weight calculator written in python for investment
Takes the individual Index Funds returns over the given amount of time as input.
Returns the weight, total return, annual rate.

# Why does it exists?
To have a convient way to do the math of my portfolio for me lol.
I came up with this idea using the beauty of basic math to figure out how much weight each asset should have that depends on it's performance.
Instead of guessing like "Mhmm ok I go 95% on America and 5% distributed equally on all the other ETFs".
I don't say it's the best way to calculate your weight. It just looks fairly distributed and depending of your portfolios future performance ca be readjusted.

# Do I have to consider something when using it?
That the input your giving is correct.
The longest historical comperison possible for the ETFs. Since we invest for the long run.
It's not there to calculate your Stocks/Bonds distribution. Although you can this is ultimatly your decision.
Last thing is that if you have 5 stocks in America and 2 for the rest of the world.
Your gonna get a very high precentage for America. At least if America's Stock Market didn't burn by the time you read this.

So you would have to put all the ETFs from America first into the calculator.
And then use the total return of your America ETFs as a single ETF input in the calculator to get a more evenly spread asset allocation.
Those 100% you got from the first calculation. Well now you have to make it fit into the second calculated percentage.
Sooooo GL HF with it.
