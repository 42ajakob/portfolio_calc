# A simple Portfolio weight calculator written in python for investment
Takes your Index Funds returns over the given amount of time as input.
Returns weights, total return, annual rate.
Based on each Index Funds performance.

# Why does it exists?
To have a convient way to do the math of my portfolio for me lol.
I came up with this idea using the beauty of basic math to figure out how much weight each asset should have that depends on it's performance.
Instead of guessing like "Mhmm ok I go 95% on America and 5% distributed equally on all the other ETFs".
I don't say it's the best way to calculate your weight.
It just looks fairly distributed and depending of your portfolios future performance can be readjusted.

# Do I have to consider something when using it?
That the input your giving is correct.
The longest historical comperison possible for the ETFs. Since we invest for the long run.
It's not there to calculate your Stocks/Bonds distribution. Although you certainly can this is ultimatly your decision.

If you have for example 5 stocks in America and 2 for the rest of the world.
Your gonna get a very high precentage for America. At least if America's Stock Market didn't burn by the time you read this.

So you would have to put all the ETFs from America first into the calculator.
Then use the total return of them as a single ETF input in the second calculation to get a more evenly spread asset allocation.
Those 100% you got from the first calculation. Well now you have to make it fit into the second calculated percentage on your own.
Sooooo GL HF with it.
